        title: "Research Proposal",
        description: "The goal of this assignment was to develop a clear, comprehensive plan for the semester's research project. We were required to identify a 'critical conversation' we wanted to join and develop a specific research question. The requirements for this assignment were very specific: we had to articulate the question, explain the conversation, choose a research method (like textual analysis or surveys), justify that method, and create a timeline for data collection. This assignment was essentially the roadmap for the entire course, ensuring that our research topics were viable, ethical, and narrow enough to complete in a few weeks.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I proposed a study on 'commit messages' within GitHub repositories. I identified that commit messages are a specific genre of communication used by software developers. My plan was to use genre analysis to compare the structure of these messages across three different projects: a solo project, a mid-sized project, and a large organization-maintained project like React. I outlined a schedule to collect 30 commit messages and code them for specific features like length, tone, and emoji usage.",
        reflection: "I chose to connect this assignment to the 'Generating Inquiry' outcome because writing this proposal was the moment I moved from just having a vague idea to having a concrete research path. The hardest part of this assignment was coming up with a research question that was not just a 'yes or no' question. I started with the idea of just looking at computer code, but I realized that was too broad. I had to drill down. I engaged with the outcome by asking myself: What specifically about code is communication? That led me to commit messages.\n\nThe process involved a lot of back and forth. I wrote a draft where I just wanted to interview programmers, but I realized I did not have the time to find participants. I had to pivot to 'textual analysis' because it was more feasible. This taught me that inquiry is not just about what you want to know, but what you can actually find out with the resources you have. By forcing me to write down a timeline and a method, this assignment made my inquiry genuine and realistic. It stopped being a hypothetical idea and became a real project with steps I could follow. This assignment was the foundation of my entire semester, proving that good research starts with a good plan.",

        title: "Annotated Bibliography",
        description: "The purpose of this assignment was to organize and evaluate the secondary sources that would support our research. We were required to find at least six sources, three of which had to be scholarly, peer-reviewed articles. For each source, we had to write an APA citation followed by two paragraphs. The first paragraph had to summarize the source's main argument, and the second paragraph had to explain why the source was credible and relevant to our specific project. This tool helps researchers verify that they have done enough background reading before they start their own writing.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I curated a list of six sources that provided the theoretical backing for my study. I found a key paper by Luzón on 'Genre Analysis' which gave me the vocabulary to talk about commit messages as a social action. I also found empirical papers by Tian et al. and Hattori & Lanza that had already done some studies on commit messages. I summarized their findings—like how 44% of commit messages are considered 'poor quality'—and explained how my project would build on their work by looking at the specific differences between solo and team projects.",
        reflection: "This assignment was the primary way I engaged with the 'Information Literacy' outcome. Before this class, I thought finding sources just meant typing keywords into Google and picking the first result that looked okay. This assignment forced me to be much more critical and strategic. I learned how to use the university library databases to find peer-reviewed articles, which are much more reliable than random blog posts.\n\nMy process involved evaluating the credibility of each author. For example, when I found the blog post by Chris Beams on 'How to write a git commit message,' I initially thought I couldn't use it because it wasn't a scholarly article. However, through the process of writing the annotation, I realized it was a 'primary source' of industry standards, which is a different kind of credibility. This distinction between academic authority and industry authority was a huge learning moment for me. I also learned how to read academic papers efficiently by focusing on the abstract and conclusion first. This assignment helped me build a 'conversation' between my sources, seeing how they agreed or disagreed with each other, rather than just treating them as isolated facts. It gave me the confidence to say that I actually understood the topic I was researching.",

        title: "Reading Response 4 (Exigency)",
        description: "The goal of this reading response was to analyze the concept of 'Exigency' based on an article by Quentin Vieregge. We were asked to discuss strategies for making writing indispensable to a reader. The prompt required us to answer specific questions about times we struggled to find a purpose for writing, and to identify examples of exigency in the real world. This assignment was designed to help us understand why we write and how to make our audience care about our topic.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I wrote about the concept of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) as a modern form of exigency used in advertising to make people pay attention immediately. I shared a personal story about struggling to write history essays and how I solved it by adopting a specific persona to make the work feel meaningful. I also analyzed 'The Anxious Generation' as a book that creates strong exigency by addressing a timely social crisis, and I noted how Vieregge uses the classroom setting itself to create exigency for students who want good grades.",
        reflection: "I connected this assignment to the 'Contributing Knowledge' outcome, though it also touches on 'Generating Inquiry.' Understanding exigency is essentially understanding why your research matters. In the past, I often wrote papers just because a teacher told me to. That is a weak form of exigency. This assignment made me realize that to contribute knowledge effectively, I have to convince the reader that there is a problem they should care about.\n\nMy process for this response was introspective. I had to look back at my own history as a student and admit that I often didn't care about my writing. By identifying 'FOMO' as a rhetorical strategy, I started to see rhetoric in my daily life, not just in textbooks. This helped me in my final paper because I realized I couldn't just list facts about commit messages; I had to explain why bad commit messages are a problem for developers. I had to create exigency for my own research. This assignment shifted my mindset from 'writing to complete a task' to 'writing to solve a problem,' which is the core of contributing new knowledge to a field.",

        title: "Reading Response 5 (Source Hunting)",
        description: "This assignment asked us to challenge traditional myths about research sources. We read articles by Harrington and Purdy that discussed credibility outside of academic journals and the potential uses of Wikipedia. The task was to answer questions about how credibility is established in non-academic genres and how our views on Wikipedia had changed. We were required to find real-world examples of non-academic credibility and cite the readings to support our answers.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I identified longform journalism and food science blogs as examples of non-academic genres that establish high credibility through transparency and detailed methodology, even without formal footnotes. I also discussed how Purdy's article changed my view of Wikipedia. I wrote about how I plan to use Wikipedia not as a final source, but as a gateway to find keywords and initial links, treating it as a research tool rather than a forbidden site.",
        reflection: "This assignment is a perfect example of the 'Information Literacy' outcome. It challenged the rigid rules I learned in high school, like 'never use Wikipedia.' Engaging with this assignment helped me understand that credibility is context-dependent. A source isn't 'good' or 'bad' on its own; it depends on how you use it.\n\nMy process involved analyzing websites I actually use, like tech blogs or cooking sites, and asking 'Why do I trust this?' I realized I trust them because they show their work, which is exactly what academic papers do. This realization made the concept of 'citation' feel less like a rule and more like a tool for building trust. When it came to Wikipedia, Purdy's argument that it is a good place to start research helped me a lot. I used to feel guilty for checking Wikipedia, but now I see it as a smart first step to get an overview before diving into complex papers. This assignment gave me a more nuanced, mature understanding of information literacy that goes beyond just checking if a source is peer-reviewed.",

        title: "ePortfolio Check-In #1",
        description: "This was an early reflection assignment designed to get us thinking about the end goal of the semester. We were asked to read about portfolio keeping and then write a response where we defined the six course outcomes in our own words. We also had to select a platform for our website and create the initial shell. The requirement was to demonstrate a preliminary understanding of what we were expected to learn by the end of the course.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I broke down the six outcomes into simple terms. For example, I defined 'Revision' not just as fixing grammar, but as a holistic re-seeing of the paper. I defined 'Research Genre Production' as the ability to adapt to different writing formats. I also set up my initial Google Site (which I later converted to this custom site) to start visualizing where my work would go.",
        reflection: "This assignment was my first real engagement with the 'Revision' outcome, even though it was early in the semester. It forced me to look ahead and plan. In the prompts, we were asked to reflect on what we wanted to get out of the course. I realized that a portfolio is not just a folder of stuff; it is a curated argument about my own learning.\n\nMy process was difficult because at the start of the semester, terms like 'Research Genre Production' sounded like nonsense to me. I had to read the syllabus closely and try to translate those academic terms into plain English. This act of translation helped me understand what I was actually supposed to be doing in the class. It set the stage for everything else. By defining the outcomes early, I had a mental checklist in the back of my head for every subsequent assignment. It helped me engage with the course intentionally rather than just blindly finishing assignments. Looking back at this check-in now, I can see how much my understanding of these concepts has deepened.",

        title: "ePortfolio Check-In #3",
        description: "For this check-in, we were required to research and analyze an existing professional portfolio from a person of our choice. We had to write 1-2 paragraphs identifying what worked well in their design and what could be improved. The goal was to start thinking about our own portfolios as public-facing websites that need to communicate effectively to an audience, not just the teacher.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I analyzed the website of Tom Scott, a famous educational YouTuber. I noted that his site was incredibly simple and functional, focusing on text and clear links rather than flashy animations. I praised his clear navigation but suggested that he could use more visuals or thumbnails to make his projects pop out more to a casual browser.",
        reflection: "This assignment helped me engage with the 'Multiple Ways of Writing' outcome. It made me think about web design as a form of writing. When I looked at Tom Scott's site, I wasn't just reading the words; I was reading the layout. I realized that the way information is organized—the colors, the spacing, the navigation—tells a story just as much as the text does.\n\nMy process involved browsing through several portfolios before picking Tom Scott's. I chose his because it was so different from the flashy, image-heavy sites I usually see. It taught me that 'good design' often means 'clarity.' This directly influenced how I built my own portfolio. I decided to keep my navigation sticky at the top and use clean, distinct sections for my content, just like he did. I also took my own advice and added a 'Show More' button feature to my site to keep the page clean while still offering deep content. This assignment shifted my focus from just writing essays to thinking about user experience and visual rhetoric.",

        title: "Research Proposal Revision Plan",
        description: "After receiving peer feedback on our Research Proposals, we were asked to create a structured revision plan. The assignment required us to categorize the feedback we received into 'Feedback I Will Use' and 'Feedback I Will Discard.' We had to justify our choices for each category and then write a detailed plan or timeline for how we would implement the changes before the final due date.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I organized my feedback into a clear list. I decided to accept feedback about simplifying my jargon because multiple peers mentioned it was confusing. I also agreed to add a glossary of terms. However, I decided to discard a suggestion to completely change my research question because it was too late in the process to start over. I outlined a plan to rewrite the methodology section to be more accessible to non-programmers.",
        reflection: "This assignment is the definition of the 'Revision' outcome. It taught me that revision is a strategic decision-making process, not just doing whatever someone tells you to do. The most important part of this assignment for me was the 'Feedback I Will Discard' section. It gave me permission to own my work. I realized that as the author, I am the final authority on my paper.\n\nMy process involved weighing the advice I got against my original goals. My peer at the writing center suggested a change that would have made the project too big for the time I had. By writing down *why* I was ignoring that advice, I actually clarified my own goals. On the other hand, the feedback about jargon was crucial. I realized I was writing for myself, not for an audience. This plan forced me to step back and look at my writing through a reader's eyes. It made my final proposal much stronger and more focused.",

        title: "Analyzing Research Methods",
        description: "This was an extra credit assignment that asked us to look for research methods in pop culture. We had to choose a character from a movie, book, or show who solves problems, summarize their method, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. The goal was to practice identifying research methodologies in non-academic contexts.",
        summary: "For this assignment, I analyzed Sherlock Holmes and his 'science of deduction.' I explained that his method involves extreme observation of minute details—like the dirt on a shoe—to infer large truths about a person. I identified his strength as his ability to link unrelated data points, but I pointed out a weakness: he often claims certainty based on incomplete data, when he should probably leave room for error.",
        reflection: "I connected this assignment to the 'Research Genre Production' and 'Generating Inquiry' outcomes. It was a fun way to think about what 'methodology' actually means. In class, we talk about surveys and textual analysis, which can be dry. But analyzing Sherlock Holmes made me realize that a methodology is just a systematic way of answering a question.\n\nMy process was fun but analytical. I had to critique a character I usually admire. When I wrote that Holmes should 'allow for more uncertainty,' I realized I was applying the same standard to him that I have to apply to my own research. In my final paper, I couldn't just say 'commit messages prove X.' I had to be careful and say 'this data suggests X.' This assignment helped me understand the importance of acknowledging limitations in research. It showed me that even geniuses like Holmes are essentially just doing research, and like all research, it has flaws that need to be accounted for.",
