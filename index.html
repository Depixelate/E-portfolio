                <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Dear Reader,</p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my academic portfolio. My name is Sukessh Velusamy, and I am a Computer Science major at
                    the University of Central Florida. When I first started this semester in ENC 1102, I thought writing
                    was mostly about grammar and following strict rules. However, over the last few months, my
                    perspective has changed completely. I have learned that writing is actually a complex process of
                    inquiry, research, and communication that varies depending on who you are talking to and why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This portfolio serves as a collection of my growth and work throughout the semester. It showcases
                    the major projects I completed, such as my Research Proposal and Final Research Paper, as well as
                    the smaller assignments that helped me build the necessary skills along the way. In this class, we
                    focused heavily on the concept of "genre" and how different communities communicate. Since I am
                    studying Computer Science, I decided to focus my research on how software developers communicate
                    through "commit messages" on GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you explore this site, you will see how I engaged with the six course learning outcomes. You will
                    see how I learned to ask better questions, how I learned to find and evaluate sources, and how I
                    learned to revise my work based on feedback from my peers. I hope this portfolio gives you a clear
                    picture of my journey as a writer and researcher this semester.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Sukessh Velusamy</p>

            <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Throughout ENC 1102, I have developed skills in the following key areas:</p>

            <div class="outcomes-grid">
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>1. Generating Inquiry</h3>
                    <p>This outcome is about learning how to ask deep, genuine questions that do not have easy answers.
                        Instead of just picking a topic and reporting facts, it requires us to find a "gap" in the
                        current conversation. We have to look at what others are saying and find a space where we can
                        add something new. It involves exploring lines of inquiry related to writing, rhetoric, or
                        literacy and keeping an open mind about where the research might lead us.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>2. Multiple Ways of Writing</h3>
                    <p>Writing is not just black text on a white page. This outcome focuses on the ability to integrate
                        different modes of communication to make an argument stronger. This includes using visuals,
                        layout design, audio, or video. It also means understanding that different situations require
                        different tools. For this class, it meant understanding how to present data visually in a chart
                        or how to design a website like this portfolio to be user-friendly and professional.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>3. Information Literacy</h3>
                    <p>We live in a world with too much information, so this outcome is crucial. It involves the ability
                        to find, evaluate, and use sources effectively. It is not just about finding a quote to support
                        a point. It is about checking if a source is credible, relevant, and ethical. It involves
                        understanding the difference between a primary source (like raw data) and a secondary source
                        (like an academic article) and knowing when to use each one to support a research project.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>4. Research Genre Production</h3>
                    <p>Every community has its own way of writing, which we call a "genre." This outcome is about
                        producing writing that fits specific public or academic contexts. It demonstrates the ability to
                        navigate the rules, choices, and constraints of these genres. For example, a research proposal
                        has different rules than a casual blog post. Mastering this outcome means being able to analyze
                        a new genre and write within its specific boundaries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>5. Contributing Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>Research is a conversation. This outcome requires us to do more than just summarize what other
                        people have said. We have to draw our own original conclusions based on the primary evidence we
                        collect. It involves analyzing data and explaining what it means, then placing that new insight
                        into conversation with existing research. It is about moving from being a consumer of
                        information to being a creator of new knowledge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="outcome-card">
                    <h3>6. Revision</h3>
                    <p>Writing is never perfect in the first draft. This outcome highlights writing as a process rather
                        than a one-time event. It demonstrates the ability to negotiate differences, accept feedback
                        from peers and instructors, and act with intention to rethink and improve writing. It involves
                        looking at the big picture, like the structure and argument, rather than just fixing spelling
                        mistakes.</p>

                    The goal of this final paper was to treat commit messages as a recurring kind of writing. It asks
                    what parts these messages usually have, what parts sometimes appear, what each part does for
                    readers, and how message form differs in different kinds of projects. The goal is to produce clear,
                    practical descriptions that readers with no programming background can understand.

                <p>The writing process for my final research paper was long and iterative. It started with my
                    <strong>First Draft</strong>, where I simply tried to get all my ideas down on paper. I combined the
                    research from my annotated bibliography with the primary data I collected from GitHub. At this
                    stage, the paper was messy. The sections did not flow well together, and I was struggling to connect
                    my specific findings about commit messages back to the larger theories of genre analysis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After completing the first draft, I participated in a <strong>Peer Review Workshop</strong>. This was
                    a turning point for my paper. My partner pointed out that my "Methods" section was too technical and
                    hard to understand for someone who does not code. They also noted that I had forgotten to include my
                    analysis chart in the body of the text. I used this feedback to rewrite the methods section,
                    removing jargon and explaining terms like "repository" and "merge" more clearly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the <strong>Final Polish</strong>, I focused on the "Revision" outcome. I read the paper out loud
                    to catch awkward sentences and citation errors. I realized that my conclusion was too abrupt, so I
                    added a section discussing the limitations of my study. This process of drafting, getting feedback,
                    and revising helped me produce a much stronger final paper than I could have written on my own.</p>
